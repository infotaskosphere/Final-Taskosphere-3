/**
 * GuidanceNote.jsx
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A small, dismissible "how do I use this page" banner + step-by-step
 * popup, meant to be dropped into any Accounts page with a single line:
 *
 *     <GuidanceNote pageKey="journal-entries" isDark={isDark} />
 *
 * Content lives centrally in GUIDANCE_CONTENT below (plain language, no
 * accounting jargon) so every page stays consistent and new pages just
 * need one new dictionary entry — no new component code.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *  - First visit: shows an amber banner with a one-line plain-English
 *    summary of the page, and a "Show me how" button that opens a modal
 *    with numbered steps.
 *  - Dismiss (X): collapses to a small "Guide" pill in the same spot so
 *    help is never more than one click away, but doesn't nag once read.
 *  - Dismissal is remembered per page (localStorage), not globally.

    steps: [
      { h: '1. Find the entry', p: 'Look through the locked entries list for the one with the wrong amount or wrong account.' },
      { h: '2. Click "Raise Adjustment"', p: 'This opens a simple form. Just say which account should go up and which should go down — no debit/credit knowledge needed.' },

    plain: "Every sale, purchase, or bank transaction creates an entry here automatically — think of it as your business's diary of money movements. You only add one manually for something that doesn't fit Sale, Purchase, or Bank.",
    steps: [
      { h: 'When do I add one manually?', p: 'Only for things outside normal sales/purchases — e.g. an owner contributing personal cash, or correcting an opening balance.' },
      { h: 'Pick the accounts', p: "Search by plain name (e.g. \"Cash\", \"Rent\") — you don't need to remember any codes." },

    steps: [
      { h: 'Browse, don\'t worry', p: 'Most buckets already exist for you — you rarely need to create new ones.' },

    steps: [
      { h: '1. Connect your GSTIN', p: 'Enter your GST number once — this links your account to the portal.' },
      { h: '2. Sync', p: 'Click sync to pull the latest balances — no manual data entry required.' },
      { h: '3. Read the numbers', p: 'The liability figure is what you owe; the credit ledger is what you can use to offset it. Your accountant can confirm the net payable if you\'re unsure.' },

  'gst-reconciliation': {
    title: 'What is GST Reconciliation?',
    plain: 'This compares the purchases you\'ve recorded against what your vendors have actually reported to the government (GSTR-2B), so you can catch missing or mismatched credit before it costs you.',
    steps: [
      { h: '1. Let it match automatically', p: 'The system pairs up your purchase records with the vendor-reported data for you.' },
      { h: '2. Look at the "unmatched" pile', p: "These are the ones that need a human look — usually a mismatched amount or invoice number." },
      { h: '3. Ask, don\'t guess', p: 'If something looks off, the fastest fix is usually a quick message to the vendor confirming the invoice number and amount.' },

    title: 'Recording a Purchase',
    plain: "Just upload the supplier's invoice (PDF or photo) — the app reads the vendor, amount, and GST for you and creates the accounting entry automatically. You don't need to enter anything by hand or know any accounting.",
    steps: [
      { h: '1. Upload the invoice', p: 'Drop in the PDF or image of the supplier bill.' },
      { h: '2. Let it match', p: 'The app matches it to the right vendor/company automatically.' },

    title: 'Creating an Invoice',
    plain: "Use this whenever your business sells something to a customer. Fill in what was sold and to whom — the system handles GST, totals, and the accounting entry for you.",

      { h: 'Day Book / Cash-Bank Book', p: 'A plain list of what happened and when — closest to a bank statement.' },
